  <p><strong>Disruption</strong> is the defining mantra of a new generation of companies. Their products and services unite the digital and physical worlds. The transformation has only just begun.
  <br><br> 
  The Internet as a communication medium with the browser as a platform is the key technology that makes this transformation possible. 
  <br><br> 
  The course <em>Basics of modern web development</em> provides the basic knowledge to develop user interfaces for the web and to apply creative concepts. Together we will develop a so-called <em>landing page</em> and deal with concepts of programming and efficient UI development for modern web browsers.

  The ability to work interdisciplinary as part of cross-functional product teams is the decisive competence in agile organizations. You get to know the methods of software developers and learn to view design requirements in the context of programmatic implementation.</p>
